### Raspberry Pi KiteMapping

This Repo will store all the software and other resources that I use on my KiteMapping rig.

Initial commit contains:

#####kite_start.sh:
Simple shell script to launch main code at startup (normally called from /etc/rc.local on Raspbian)

#####kite6.py:

Main Python code to interface with Pi camera and Xtrinsic board.
